# Docker Setup

## Requirements: 
- Completed Ch 1-3, or you have ssh access to a linux machine with root permissions.

## Steps
1. Use SSH and get into your linux machine.
2. Download docker.
  - https://docker.com
3. Make sure docker is running and available for usage by running `docker ps` in the terminal.
4. Run a simple Hello World docker container.
5. Delete that container then delete that docker image.
6. Run a simple website through docker hosted on port 8080. Make sure to do docker port forwarding with `-p` command line option.
7. Go to a web browser and type in `http://IP_ADDRESS:8080` where IP_ADDRESS is the localip of your linux server. Verify you can see the website.
8. Familiarize yourself with the `docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID` syntax and go into the docker container and try to change the websites contents.
9. Make changes to your website that persist and use `-v` volume mounts to specify a volume for data.
  - You will need to potentially stop/start/remove containers while you test new html pages.

Congraulations you have hosted a website through docker and have familiarized yourself with the basics!

## Extra Credit
- Port forward similarly in ch3 port 8080 and make your website available for the world/internet.
- Get your home's external ip and put in `http://IP_ADDRESS:8080` verify it's available while not connected to your home router.
- It's a good idea after that to remove these port forwarding rules if you don't intend to use the long term.
