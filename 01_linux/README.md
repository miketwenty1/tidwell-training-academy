# LINUX 
#### Requirements: 
- A laptop or desktop you aren't using/needing to load Linux onto.
- A thumbdrive you aren't using/needing to install/boot Linux.
- Download latest Ubuntu LTS iso image file (currently version 20.04)
  - https://ubuntu.com/download (Ubuntu Desktop)
- Create a bootable USB drive using the downloaded iso image.
  - There are various tutorials available online to walk you through this process of configuring a USB drive to boot Ubuntu. Below I have my suggestions.
  - Tidwell Recommendation on which software to use:
    - For Mac use Etcher
    - For Windows use Yumi
    - For Linux use "dd" command (if you're already using Linux)
- Figure out how to boot up Ubuntu when you have the USB drive plugged in.
  - Usually inolves turning on the computer and before it boots, you press a certain f-key like f9 or f11. Do some research to figure out the proper key. You may also need to to some BIOS configuration. 
  - Depending on USB drive and Computer you may run into issues. Google Away!
    - My favoritate reliable USB drives for this kind of stuff is SANDISK brand.

- After you boot up, open up the "Terminal" then type in:
  - `expr 1 + 1`
  - Result should be "2" 

Congraulations you have used the terminal and you are running Linux on that old dusty laptop of. Come back to me for another assignment.
